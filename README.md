# Java Banking System ðŸ’³

A simple **Java-based Banking Management System** that allows users to create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, transfer funds, check balances, and view transaction history.  
This repository contains a single-file, easy-to-run implementation (`BankingSystem.java`) that uses Java serialization for persistence.

- Create a new bank account (account number chosen by user)
- PIN-based authentication for account-sensitive operations
- Deposit money into an account
- Withdraw money with:
  - Minimum balance enforcement (â‚¹500)
  - Daily withdrawal limit (â‚¹10,000)
- Transfer money between accounts
- View transaction history (per account)
- Data persistence to `bank_data.ser` (accounts saved between runs)
- Currency displayed in **Indian Rupees (â‚¹)** using `NumberFormat` for India

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java (JDK 8+ recommended)
- **Key APIs:** `java.io.Serializable`, `ObjectInputStream`/`ObjectOutputStream`, `NumberFormat`, `HashMap`
- **Persistence:** Java object serialization to `bank_data.ser`
